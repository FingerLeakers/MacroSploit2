Macrosploit - Multi Platform Social Engineering / Penetration Testing Macro Payload
===========

Microsoft Word Macros have been used successfully as social engineering payloads for penetration testers for years. This method does not actually use any exploits, it uses the intended functionality of a macro for unintended purposes. If you can trick a user into enabling Macros then code execution on the users system is possible. Macrosploit introduces a new method for the built in Applescript of OS X operating systems and the built in Powershell of Windows to create one office document that will work on both platforms. Future plans include a macro for LibreOffice in Linux. 
Tested and working on the following:

Windows 7 Pro x64 - Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010

OS X 10.9.5 - Microsoft Word for Mac 2011 14.2.0

Features:

Automatically runs on document open when Macros are enabled

OS X Persistent Reverse Shell using Bash and Plist persistence

Bypasses built in OS X GateKeeper Security!!!

What it does:

On Mac it will create a reverse shell connection to the listener that you must specify
It uses the plist method of persistance so that a new reverse shell is attempted ever 120 seconds (WARNING: You must manually remove the com.apple.video2.plist file or unload plist to remove this persistance). The Macro attempts to run with root privileges, if successful it sets up a reverse shell with root privileges, it will also set up a user reverse shell in case the root privileges can not be obtained. 

On Windows it will execute powershell payload of your choice this could be a reverse shell, Meterpreter, or Beacon if you have access to Cobalt Strike (www.advancedpentest.com).

How to use it:

For the Mac payload just change the reverse shell listener to your listener IP address, change the port (currently 4444) to your listener port. E.g. nc -lvp 1234 (or use the generic/shell_reverse_tcp in Metasploit). For the Windows payload change to the powershell command of your choice.

Future Plans

Create a script (SET like) to automate creation of Macro using selection of payloads, automate starting listener.

Test on Libre Office / Open Office for Linux reverse shell so that one payload can work on Windows, OSX, Linux and Unix.
