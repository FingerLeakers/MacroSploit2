I have found that an effective way of packaging the Macro is in a word document named Vacation Photos. 
This could be Vacation_Photos_CEO-Name-Here.doc or really anything. 
The idea is to make the name of the file interesting enough that someone would want to open it bad. 
Bad enough to go against thier better judgement and allow macros just to load the photos. 
Unfortunately for the user that opens the document there is a present inside but it does not include any vacation photos :)

The text in the document can simply be something like this:


Windows Users - Photos cannot be viewed unless editing is enabled and content is enabled. Please make sure to select the ”Enable Editing” and “Enable Content” buttons above to view this document.

Mac Users – Please reopen this document and select “Enable Macros” to view photos.
